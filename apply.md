# DEERS Application 

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://ncsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9TeZHLzDgEux3gx?Q_JFE=qdg">Apply for DEERS 2023</a>

Interested in running an empirical CS education research project and want to work with other like-minded researchers?

Are you not sure how to get started with a research project in your classroom?

We invite you to apply for the 7th Workshop on Developing Empirical Education Research Studies in CS (DEERS), taking place July 12-14, 2022, at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA.

The goal of the 2 1/2-day workshop is to create a replicable empirical research study to assess a meaningful educational research question.  Workshop participants will work together and with the workshop organizers to create individual research plans that will be run in future classes. To reduce the burden of conducting the study in your classroom, we will provide continuing support (e.g., anonymization, development of automated analysis, etc.) for developing and running the study.

Participants will be expected to commit to the following that will hopefully lead to one or more publications on the work:

* Attend the summer workshop from July 12-14, 2022, in Charlottesville, VA
* Run your study in a class during AY 22-23
* Participate in bi-weekly follow-on calls to keep studies on track
* Attend a follow-on three-hour workshop at SIGCSE TS 2023 (either in-person or virtual)

The University of Virginia is currently under mask-optional guidelines for indoor events.  Participants are welcome and encouraged to mask if that would make them more comfortable, but it will not be required.  We do ask all participants to provide proof of vaccination or negative PCR COVID test prior to attending.

Deadline for application is May 1.  Notification of participation will be toward the middle of May.
