# DEERS Application 

Interested in running an empirical CS education research project and want to work with other like-minded researchers?

Are you not sure how to get started with a research project in your classroom?

We invite you to apply for the next Workshop on Developing Empirical Education Research Studies in CS (DEERS) in the summer of 2022.

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://ncsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9TeZHLzDgEux3gx?Q_JFE=qdg">Apply for DEERS 2022</a>

As of now, we do not have dates scheduled, nor do we know if we will be in-person or virtual.  If we are in-person, we will provide travel funding for all successful applicants.

The goal of the workshop is to create a replicable empirical research study to assess a meaningful educational research question.  Workshop participants will work together and with the workshop organizers to create individual research plans that will be run in future classes. To reduce the burden of conducting the study in your classroom, we will provide continuing support (e.g., anonymization, development of automated analysis, etc.) for developing and running the study that will become part of the replication package.

Participants will be expected to commit to the following that will hopefully lead to one or more publications on the work:
* Attend the workshop
* Run your study in a class during AY 22-23
* Participate in bi-weekly follow-on calls to keep studies on track
* Attend a follow-on workshop at the following SIGCSE TS

The deadline for applications is April 15th each year.  Notification of participation will be toward the end of April/beginning of May.
 
If you have any questions about DEERS or how to apply, feel free to email us at deers@empiricalcsed.org.

The workshop is supported by a National Science Foundation I-USE grant titled “Transforming Computer Science Education Research Through Use of Appropriate Empirical Research Methods: Mentoring and Tutorials” (DUE #1525373).
