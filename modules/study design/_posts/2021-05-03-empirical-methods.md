# Introduction to Empirical Methods

**Empirical research methods** are one approach for validating claims. Other approach researchers often use to validate claims include **persuasion**, **implementation (existence proof)**, or **analysis**.

The term **empirical** can simply be defined as _based on observation_. So, in other words, when we are using empirical research methods, we are basing our conclusions upon observations drawn from some type of research setting. These observations take the form of various types of data, which can be collected using different approaches. This module will provide more details on those concepts.
