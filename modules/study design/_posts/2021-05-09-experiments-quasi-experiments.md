# Experiments vs. Quasi-Experiments
In study designs where there are multiple groups of participants (e.g. the Two Groups Pre-Test/Post-Test design from the previous sub-module) the method used by the researcher to allocate the participants to the groups determines whether the study is an **Experiment** or a **Quasi-Experiment**. The primary difference is that in an **experiment** the researcher uses *randomization* or *control* to create the groups. While in a **quasi-experiment** the researcher does not have this level of control.

In an **experiment** the researcher
- Manipulates the Independent Variable to create groups with different levels of the variable
- Compares the group based upon the measured Dependent Variable(s)
- Keeps all other variables as constant as possible through *randomization* or *control*.

In the case of **randomization**, the researcher assigns participants randomly to the groups. If the sample size is large enough, then randomization should help balance the effects of any *uncontrolled* variables across the groups. In the case of **control**, if the researcher has a belief that there is a key *uncontrolled* variable that may impact the results, the researcher can use that variable to balance the groups. For example, in an educational setting, a researcher could use student performance in prior courses as a measure of ability and balance the groups based on this measure.

### Internal Validity
The overall goal in study design is to create a study such that the only factor that can impact the *Dependent Variable* is the *Independent Variable* under study. The more the researcher can reduce the potential effects of other *Uncontrolled Variables*, the higher confidence they can have in the results.
