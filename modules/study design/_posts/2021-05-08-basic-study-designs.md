# Basic Study Designs
There are two basic types of study designs: *Descriptive* and *Evaluative*. The goal of descriptive studies is to describe some phenomenon based on observations gathered in various ways. Types of descriptives studies include case studies, observation, interviews, focus groups, or surveys. Another module covers these types of studies in more detail.

The goal of evaluative studies is to test a hypothesis or theory based upon on observations. Types of evaluative studies included controlled experiments, quasi-experiments, or mixed methods. The following text describes four basic types of evaluative studies.


### Single Group Post-Test Only
This is the most basic type of study. As the name suggests, this study design has only one group, meaning that all participants undergo exactly the same procedure. This study design also gathers data using only a post-test, or a data collection activity performed at the end of the study. As the figure below shows, there are two primary steps in this study design:
- Introduce the Independent Variable
- Measure the effect (or gather the Dependent Variable)

The biggest weaknesses to this approach are:
- There is no comparison group to help the researcher understand whether the measure of the Dependent Variable is _good_.
- There is no baseline or measure before the treatment to allow the researcher to observe change.

These weaknesses prompt the development of more complicated study designs.

### Two Groups Post-Test Only
