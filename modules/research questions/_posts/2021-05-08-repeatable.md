# Is It Repeatable?

Research performed at one institution with one specific set of students is interesting.  Showing that the results apply to other institutions and/or other sets of students is *powerful*.  

Having a question that is narrowly focused on your own circumstances doesn't necessarily make a research question bad, but it does make its impact narrower.  How can you focus your question so that the experiment could be repeated in other settings?

Sometimes, this is impossible to do given the nature of the project.  For instance, a question regarding an opportunity special to your program (perhaps a very particular change in the overall curriculum of the program) could be hard to replicate.  This shouldn't stop you from investigating, but be mindful about drawing sweeping conclusions under these circumstances.
