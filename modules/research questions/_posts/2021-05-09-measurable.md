# Is It Measurable?

When refining your research question, you should start to think about what metrics or data you could be gather to help answer the question.  

Some examples include:

* Survey data (Likert scale, free form, etc.)
* Assessment scores (assignments, tests, etc.)
* Demographic data
* Retention data
* Major declaration data

You will want to identify potential data sources early in the process.  Because if you cannot reasonably see how you will gather the data you need while you are writing the research question, you may be setting yourself up for a tough time ahead.
