# What Makes a Good Research Question?

A good research question is:

* Interesting - Is the question of interest to you and/or the community?
* Answerable - Is this something that you can come to some relatively definitive conclusion on?
* Repeatable - Can this study be repeated in the future (either by you or, even better, by someone else)?
* Measureable - Are there metrics that you can gather or specific questions you can ask to lead you to a conclusion? 
* Appropriately Scoped - Can you answer the question within a reasonable time frame with acceptable resources?

Let's look at each one of these individually.
