# Examining Your Research Question

You are now prepared to look at your own research question and start refinining it!

Ask yourself these questions:

* What is the overarching goal?  What do you hope to show / improve?
* What questions should you ask to try to answer your research question?
* What metrics do you need to gather to answer the questions?
* Are there specific data items you need to gather?
* How might you gather them?
* Does your research question meet the criteria of:
    * Interesting
    * Answerable
    * Repeatable
    * Measurable
    * Appropriately scoped
