# Theory

Theory, particularly educational theory, can guide the development of a research study, provide a lens for the research and interpretation of results.  CER can test existing educational theories and can help generate new theories.  

The [ICER 2021 Author Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15F7T0J4_YkVplAvgF5zF4FtaA35s9GY--ZFNJhyybHk/edit#heading=h.lkvfg7g00z6a) provide a discussion on how theory might be used in CER.  Several recent papers have considered the use of theory in CER:
