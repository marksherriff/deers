# Introduction to DEERS

Welcome to the *Designing Empirical Education Research Studies (DEERS)* online coursepack!

Our goal is to support educators in conducting high-quality empirical Computing Education Research (CER) studies in their classrooms, summer camps, professional developments, or other computing education activities. 

Our review of CER literature from 2014 and 2015 found that while over 80% of papers contained some level of empirical work, the current state of the literature is lacking information needed for replication. Our DEERS coursepack can support the computing education researcher in designing a high-quality, replicable, study that can contribute to the community.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the DEERS Workshop, you will...

  * Develop research questions(s) around teaching and learning;
  * Differentiate between various methodologies and research designs:
  * Design a study to implement in your course;
  * Recognize the value in conducting [Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL)](../sotl) in CS
  
  
## Literature Reviews
We have conducted two CER literature reviews on the norms of reporting empirical work.
