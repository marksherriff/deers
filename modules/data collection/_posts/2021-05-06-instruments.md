# Instruments

An instrument is a tool to support the collection of measurements related to a phenomenon of interest. Many instruments have been created to support empirical educational work and utilizing an existing instrument can save time and support comparisons with prior work. 

[csedresearch.org](https://csedresearch.org/choosing-an-evaluation-instrument/) maintains a listing of [evaluation instruments](https://csedresearch.org/eval-instrument-summary-table/) frequently used in K-12 computing education research.  Additional instruments are available in computing education literature.

A few commonly used instruments are listed below:

## Computing Attitudes Survey (CAS) v4
The CAS instrument [[TDS12](../references#TDS12), [DT13](../references#DT13), [TD13](../references#TD13), [DT15](../references#DT15)] has 26 questions focused on problem solving in introductory computing classes. The instrument considers four main factors: transfer, strategies, fixed mindset, and real-world connections

## Assess Student Self-Beliefs in CS1
The Self-Beliefs in CS1 instrument [[SG14]](../references#SG14) has 19 questions focused on CS1 students.  The instrument considers four main factors: debugging self-efficacy, programming self-concept, programming interest, programming anxiety, and programming aptitude mindset.

## Computer Programming Self-Efficacy Scale
There are four factors considered in the computer programming self-efficacy scale [[RW98]](../references#RW98): independence and persistence, complex programming tasks, self-regulation, simple programming tasks.
