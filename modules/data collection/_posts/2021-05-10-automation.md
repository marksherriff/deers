# Automation
Automation of data collection (and later [data analysis](../../data analysis/introduction)) can be helpful to manage multiple data sources and potentially large data sets.  Transforming raw data into useful measures associated with variables that answer your research can be a challenge and automation can help with data wrangling.

There are tools that can help automate data collection and wrangling:

  * Online survey tools (Qualtrics, Google Forms, etc.)
  * Learning management systems (Sakai, Moodle, Blackboard, etc.)
  * Time tracking tools (Toggle, etc.)
  * Version control systems (GitHub, GitLabs, CVS, etc.)
  * Automated grading systems (WebCAT, Gradescope, etc.)
  * Continuous integration system (Jenkins, TravisCI, etc.)
  * Shared workspaces (Google Drive, etc.)
  * Specialty tools (NVivo, etc.)
  * Custom-made solutions (Eclipse plugin to gather student keystrokes)
  
Where possible use tools to support your data collection and wrangling while meeting expectations of the [data management plan](../management).
