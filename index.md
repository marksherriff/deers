* The 2022 Summer Workshop will take place the week of July 11-15, 2022.
* Currently, we are evaluating whether we will be in-person (at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA) or fully virtual.
* We will take into account the desires of those that apply and are accepted in our decision, in addition to current travel guidelines and restrictions from UVA and other institutions.

Interested in running an empirical CS education research project and not sure how to get started with a research project in your classroom?  

The Designing Empirical Education Research Studies (DEERS) project is an NSF-funded grant geared to help faculty learn how to better perform empirical scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) studies in their classrooms.  Every summer, we invite computing faculty to apply for the DEERS Workshop, where we work with faculty on designing their research projects that they then perform during the next academic year.

The educational material on this site was created from the material generated for both the in-person and virtual versions of the DEERS Workshop.  Some of the material here is insipired by "Engaging in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning" by Bishop-Clark and Dietz-Uhler, which we highly recommend to anyone interested in engaging in SoTL work.

While we cannot offer individual assistance for researchers who are not a part of our workshop cohorts, we hope that the material here will help those who are starting their own SoTL reserach projects.
