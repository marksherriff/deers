# DEERS Showcase 2022 at SIGCSE TS 

Welcome to DEERS Showcase 2022 at SIGCSE TS!

## About DEERS

The Designing Empirical Education Research Studies (DEERS) project is an NSF-funded grant geared to help faculty learn how to better perform empirical scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) studies in their classrooms. Every summer, we invite computing faculty to apply for the DEERS Workshop, where we work with faculty on designing their research projects that they then perform during the next academic year. For more information about DEERS, please go to [http://empiricalcsed.org](http://empiricalcsed.org).

# About the DEERS Showcase
After running six DEERS workshops between 2016 and 2021, the DEERS Showcase will provide a venue for workshop alumni to share their research studies and findings with the SIGCSE Technical Symposium community. We invite the SIGCSE Technical Symposium community to explore the work of DEERS alumni at various stages of progress and provide feedback on future directions.
